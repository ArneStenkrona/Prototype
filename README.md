# Prototype

Prototype is a simple 2D game engine. As of yet it is in a very 
rudimentary stage. This project is solely developed as a hobby 
and learning experience.

It is written in C++ and makes us of [SDL](https://www.libsdl.org/
).
## Getting Started

Clone the repository containing the Visual Studio project and open the solution using Visual Studio 2017.
Example:

```
Open Visual Studio 2017
```
```
Navigate, using the tabs, into File->Open->Open From Source Control
```
```
In the Team Explorer panel, find the clone option and enter the repository URL
```
```
Open the solution and set the platform to x86
```

It is also recommended to set the solution explorer to 'Show All Files' to get a
proper view of the file hierarchy. The game will run more slowly if solution is set to
'debug'. Set solution to 'release' if performance is slow.

## Built With

* [SDL](https://www.libsdl.org/) - Layer for graphics, sound and multimedia
* [Tiny Soundfont](https://github.com/schellingb/TinySoundFont) - Used in soundfont rendering and midi playback

Both these dependencies are included in the repository. However, there is no gaurantee that I've provided the latest versions.

## Contributing

As of yet, I, Arne Stenkrona, am sole contributor to the repository.
