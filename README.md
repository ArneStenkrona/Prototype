# Prototype
2D game engine.

Prototype is a simple 2D game engine. As of yet it is in a very 
rudimentary stage. Prototype was initially created without a 
repository. In conjuction with creating a git repository, I decided
to refactor the project to make it more comprehensible. This project
is solely developed as a hobby and learning experience.

Prototype utilizes the SDL library for multimedia purposes and imgui for GUI purposes.
